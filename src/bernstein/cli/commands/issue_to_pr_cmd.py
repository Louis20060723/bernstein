"""``bernstein issue-to-pr`` -- inspect the issue -> PR pipeline state.

The CLI is intentionally thin: real logic lives in
:mod:`bernstein.core.orchestration.issue_to_pr`.  This module just glues
click flags to the pipeline trace primitive and prints a status summary.

Only the ``trace`` subcommand is exposed for now.  Ticking the pipeline
is driven from the daemon or a manual call into the module; the CLI
intentionally avoids being a fourth way to advance state.
